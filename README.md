# HERO.IO

## App Name
**HERO.IO** - App Store Platform

## Description

A simple app store where you can browse apps, search for what you need, and keep track of what you've installed. Built this to practice React and make something that actually looks good.

You can:
- Browse through 20 different apps
- Search apps by name
- See details like ratings, downloads, and reviews
- Install/uninstall apps (saved in browser storage)
- Sort your installed apps by download count
- Works on phone, tablet, and desktop

The UI has a purple gradient theme that I think looks pretty cool. Also added some nice charts to show rating distributions.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - Main framework
